<h5>Important: </h5>
<p>InvoiceDetails rows are like line items on a reciept, and Invoices are the grand total at the bottom of the receipt.
    Each row in the Invoices table represents the total amount owed by one Gardener for all their purchases represented
    in the
    InvoiceDetails table. </p>

<p>Before creating an InvoiceDetails row, an Invoices row must be created. The totalCost attribute will be set to a
    starting value of $0.00. When an InvoiceDetails item is added, the totalCost of the
    Invoice will be updated.</p>

<p>Invoices cannot be edited or deleted, but if a Gardener is deleted, that Gardener's record in the Invoices and
    InvoiceDetails
    tables will be converted to NULL values.</p>
